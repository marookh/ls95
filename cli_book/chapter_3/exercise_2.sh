# The PATH variable determines which files can be executed without specifying their path explicitly. Run through the commands in this exercise to see this principle in action.

# Set the current PATH variable to another variable so we can revert to it later:

$ OLDPATH=$PATH
$ echo $OLDPATH
/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/aws/bin:/home/ubuntu/bin
# Temporarily change PATH and try to run a program that is no longer located in the directories specified in PATH:

$ cd /usr/local
$ ls
bin etc games include lib man sbin share src
$ PATH="" ls
-bash: ls: No such file or directory
$ ls
bin etc games include lib man sbin share src

# Now, create an executable in your home directory by entering the following:
cd ~
echo '#!/bin/bash' > test.sh # Replace existing test.sh file
echo 'echo "Hello world"' >> test.sh
chmod +x test.sh # Make sure test.sh has the executable permission

# Run the executable, first by specifying the path, then by running it like a command:

$ ./test.sh
Hello world
$ test.sh
-bash: test.sh: command not found

# Now, change PATH more permanently for your current session, and try to run test.sh again:

$ PATH=$PATH:$HOME
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/aws/bin:/home/ubuntu/bin:/home/ubuntu
$ test.sh
Hello world
$ cd /
$ test.sh
Hello world

# Exit out of Terminal and then open it up again. Try running test.sh again:
$ test.sh
-bash: test.sh: command not found
